# hits

> **Inferred annotation** — This reasoning was generated post-hoc from static code analysis. No session context, commit history, or developer intent was available. Confidence: **88%**

## Purpose

This block executes a multi-resource search operation by querying four distinct entity types with the same search query. It combines all results into a single `hits` array, enabling unified search functionality across a heterogeneous codebase structure. This likely supports a search feature in the CLI that allows users to find content across different organizational levels (code blocks, files, filesystem folders, and sessions).

## Inferred Design Rationale

- **Uniform search interface:** The code applies the same `textSearch()` function to each resource type with consistent parameters, suggesting a design pattern where search logic is centralized and reusable. (Observing)

- **Type-specific accessor functions:** Each resource type passes a different accessor function (`fm.symbolic_ref`, `fm.path`, `fm.id`) to `textSearch()`, likely because each frontmatter type exposes different identifying fields. This indicates the search function accepts a customizable key extractor. (Inferring)

- **Spread operator aggregation:** Using `...` to flatten results from four separate searches into one array suggests the calling code expects a unified result set rather than nested structures. (Observing)

- **Resource type labeling:** The second parameter to `textSearch()` ('block', 'file', 'folder', 'session') appears to be a resource type identifier, probably stored in the `SearchHit` object to preserve result origin information for UI rendering or filtering. (Inferring)

## What Cannot Be Determined

- **[Performance strategy]:** Whether `textSearch()` performs sequential or parallel searches, and whether there are performance implications for querying against large datasets in `blocks`, `files`, `folders`, and `sessions`.

- **[Business logic of textSearch()]:** The exact matching algorithm—whether it's substring matching, fuzzy matching, regex-based, or ranked relevance—is unknown from this code alone.

- **[Result ordering]:** Whether the array order (blocks first, then files, folders, sessions) is intentional for UX prioritization or merely arbitrary.

- **[SearchHit structure]:** What additional metadata is included in `SearchHit` objects and how type information is stored for downstream consumption.

- **[Data source origin]:** Where `blocks`, `files`, `folders`, and `sessions` objects are populated from, and whether they represent the complete dataset or filtered subsets.
